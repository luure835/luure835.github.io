So, as one journey ends, another begins. I left Dunedin today, after completing my BSc in Genetics to start a new journey into Auckland and a medical degree. It's all very exciting, really. But the feelings are mixed regarding this. I've traveled enough that the prospect of a bigger city barely phases me, and the prospect of more study is to me, merely another mountain that I know I can cross. It's a bit funny compared to the nervous wreck I was coming down to Dunedin. When you can stare your troubles down and say it'll all be alright, you know you've become stronger. That was the most precious gift this city could have given me: the space to grow into my own sense of self.

I reckon the best thing I could give back to it is by growing further, developing myself continuously and never forgetting the good old scarfie attitude or the sheer kindness of all the people who have helped me along.

And so one overturns the other, folding under and over like the carapace of a beetle.
